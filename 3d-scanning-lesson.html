					<h2>The History & Uses of 3D Scanning<h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h3>3D Scanning Timeline</h3>
						<dl>1960s</dl>
						<dd>Lasers: scientists discover how to shoot tight, focused beams of light at objects. Thus, the laser is born.</dd>
						<dl>1980s</dl>
						<dd>Early use of scanning: professionals in certain fields (military, land survey, mining) start combining lasers with computers to record and map areas. However, the limits of computing power and camera resolution cap these technologies accuracy</dd>
						<p><em>Ebrahim, 2014</em></p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<dl>1990s</dl>
						<dd>Handheld scanning: Imporvements in computers and cameras imporve accuracy and expand applications. They also allow the development of the first handheld scanners</dd>
						<dl>2000s</dl>
						<dd>3D Printing: Scanning technologies continue to expand, most famously in movies, TV, & video games. More importantly, 3D printers start becoming commercially available, allowing the 3D scans to be physically reproduced</dd>
						<p><em>Breuckmann, 2014</em></p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<dl>2010s & 2020s</dl>
						<dd>Increased growth: as 3D scanneres and 3D printers become cheaper and more available, more fields incorporate them into their practice.</dd>
						<p>Why does this matter?</p>
						</p><strong>It reminds us of scanning's two key components: Applying light to a surface (via a laser or strucutre light source) and making caluclations (via a computer) based on what's reflected back.</strong></p>
					</section>
				</section>

					<h2>Other fields that use 3D Scanning</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Medicine (e.g., dentistry & orthopedics)</li>
						<li>Movies & TV</li>
						<li>Civil Engineering, Real Estate, & Building</li>
						<li>Cultural Heritage</li>
						<p><em>Ebrahim, 2014; Breuckmann, 2014; Milosz & KÄ™sik, 2023</em></p>
					</ul>
					<p>Why does this matter?</p>
					</p><strong>3D scanning is not a "STEM" or "tech" skill. It's one that's part of almost every field in the world</strong></p>

					<section><h2>3D Scanning Techniques</h2></section>
					<section>
						<h3>Technique #1: Turntable Scanner</h3>
						<iframe width="373" height="210" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OZSYoixKTVQ?si=r1tnyWebNnmy1wnF" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
						<p>This is the simplest of the three machines in that data collection (determining how many scans to make and from what distance) is mechanized</p>
						<p>In the makersapce, we have one turntable scanner, the EinScan-SP. This works best for capturing the exterior of objects so that they can be 3D printed.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Technique #2: Handheld Scanner</h3>
						<iframe width="373" height="210" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gWl4hNZIvzg?si=Mp1jqTNxdl9ZqbCI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
						<p>These scanners are more difficult to collect data with, but also are better at capturing detail.</p>
						<p>In the makerspace, we have one handheld scanner, the EinScan H. It can be used for 3D scans that include texture.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Technique #3: Photogrammetry</h3>
						<iframe width="373" height="210" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iIpmRMAngPY?si=oQi-ufi8UeRr03Ca" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
						<p>The most difficult method. It uses a camera, rather than a laser, to get get greater detail. You need take several photos, digitally process them, and mesh them in specialty software like Agisoft.</p>
						<p>Special Collections has a few sets of photogrammatery equipment. They are good for capturing 3D spaces.</p>

					<h2>Printing and sharing 3D Scans</h2>
					<p>Once you've completed your 3D scan there are two ways you can share it with others</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
					<p>1. 3D Printing: If your goal is to produce a tangible object, you can produce your scan on a 3D printer. So long as you save or export it as a .obj or .stl file type, it can be printed on our our devices in the Bryn Mawr makerspace or a printer outside campus. That said, there are some things to keep in mind about 3D pritning.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
							<ul>
								<li>Prints need to be prepared: Even if your 3D scan is perfect, it will still need to be prepared for printing. For the makerspace's printers, we have a software, Cura, that prepares objects for printing, which you will have to use.</li>
								<li>Prints can take awhile: depending on the size of the object you scan, printing it can take several. Sometimes, it can even take over 24 hours.</li>
								<li>Prints aren't perfect: Sometimes a print job just doesn't come out right, either due to a printer error or a problem with the file. Be prepared for this possibility!</li>
							</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
							<p>2. A digital repository: Rather than producing a tangiable artifact, you may want to make your artifact available to others. There are several sites that host open-educational resource (OER) scanning files. One of the biggest is <a href="https://www.morphosource.org/?locale=en">Morphosource </a>from Duke University.</p>
